# Public release of a poorly written rewrite of a poorly written "arcadey" game thing
Don't get your hopes up in terms of quality, it's pretty dang bad. Original version, sans the 1-2 crash fixes I did, should be under releases

Requires python and a pygame install, if you have python type `pip install pygame` into a terminal and it should work from there
I'm not hard to find online if it doesn't work so contact me and i'll probably fix it at some point.

laugh at my old code

Oh yeah, i'm not really sure what TESTING_crt.py is for but it was there so whatever, it stays

---------BELOW THIS LINE IS PART OF THE ORIGINAL README------------------

Now onto the game itself - movement(wasd or arrow keys) is relative to the cursor, autofire is enabled
Escape to pause/unpause
Press Space in the end of game screen to save a screenshot to the local filepath /screenshots/
Get a high score or something, I don't know.
Honestly I only finished this so I could say I've finished a game, no matter how shitty it is.
